# Python_EDA_ExploratoryDataAnalysis
EDA is Explanatory Data Analysis. There are many factors that influence the grades/scores of students. One of the factors is study hours. In this mini analysis project, there are 3 models that will learn and predict the relation between study hours of students and thei scores in an exam/test.

**Goals :**
-  Range of best number of study hours to get a high score
-  Minimum and maximum number of study hours that are good for learning
-  Range of study hours that are less suitable for getting good scores or grades
-  Finding the best Machine Learning model from [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org) library to predict and answer the three goals above

With this analysis, the students are able to find the perfect range of study hours for getting good scores.

**Insights :**
- Study Hours and Scores are strongly relateddisarankan
- Studying for 12 hours and above per day can increase the chances of getting high scores
- Approximately 4 hours of study time and 2 hours or less is the ideal time to study

**Advices :**
- Some students should not study for 3 hours, 6 hours, or 10 hours per day
- Because the dataset is still very small, which only amounts to 2 columns and 25 rows, the results of the conclusions obtained may not be valid or not representative of the existing sample
- The size of the dataset should be further expanded
