# Python_EDA_ExploratoryDataAnalysis
EDA is Explanatory Data Analysis. There are many factors that influence the grades/scores of students. One of the factors is study hours. In this mini analysis project, there are 3 models that will learn and predict the relation between study hours of students and thei scores in an exam/test.

**Goals :**
-  Range of best number of study hours to get a high score
-  Minimum and maximum number of study hours that are good for learning
-  Range of study hours that are less suitable for getting good scores or grades

With this analysis, the students are able to find the perfect range of study hours for getting good scores.
